# Disk and Washer Method Interactive Website

An interactive learning tool for understanding the Disk and Washer Method concepts from AP Calculus AB.

## Overview

This website provides interactive simulations, 3D models, and detailed explanations of the Disk and Washer Method used for calculating volumes of revolution in calculus. The interactive elements help visualize how these methods work, making complex calculus concepts more accessible.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualizations of disk and washer methods
- Step-by-step explanations with LaTeX formatted equations
- Customizable functions and parameters for experimentation
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Real-time volume calculations

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Three.js (for 3D visualization)
- MathJax (for LaTeX rendering)
- Chart.js (for 2D function plotting)

## How to Use

1. Visit [https://tarushvkodes.github.io/disknwasher/](https://tarushvkodes.github.io/disknwasher/)
2. Select either the Disk Method or Washer Method from the navigation
3. Interact with the visualizations by:
   - Modifying the function using the input fields
   - Adjusting the axis of rotation
   - Changing the bounds of integration
   - Rotating the 3D model to view from different angles
